# ENGO551_Lab4

Hello, 

I have completed Lab 4 of ENGO551 here.

In Index.html, you can find code that was created by myself and chatGPT. I had to troubleshoot with the different toggles, and chatGPT helped me to format the overall page, as well as get the style URLs to work. I found the main code on the mapbox website.

I started with the code from this website (https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox.js/example/v1.0.0/plain-leaflet/)

I then used these prompts, and my own coding:

I found this url as a style url, how do I use it with an api?(mapbox://styles/macdressler/cltltqsr8014z01ragy4fbz2k)
I want to make a website that will show data that I have created in mapbox. How should I use run this html file in vs code? Also, how can I center the map on Calgary using Leaflet?

I also would like to talk about my map. I changed the colour to red to symbolize danger, and made the opacity 50% so that you could see the areas with many crashes. I also did some queries in order to change the symbology for certain types of crashes. As multi vehicle crashes are much worse, I made these crashes 10px instead of 5. Stalling is much better than a crash, so I made this symbology green.
